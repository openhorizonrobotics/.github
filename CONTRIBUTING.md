## Code of Conduct

Please read and adhere to our Code of Conduct in all interactions. We expect all contributors to uphold these standards.

## Asking for Help

If you need help, feel free to reach out by opening an issue or joining our discussion forum. Provide as much detail as possible to help us assist you effectively.

## Raising Issues

### Bug Reports

Filing an issue is a great way to contribute to the project! Bug reports help us identify and fix problems faster. If you’ve run into something unexpected, we’d love to hear about it. Before opening a new issue, please consider the following:

* **Is it really a bug?**
  + Describe what you expected to happen versus what actually happened. This helps us understand the problem clearly.

* **Include clear steps to reproduce**
  + The more specific, the better! Walk us through how you encountered the bug so we can replicate it on our end.

* **Add relevant details**
  + Screenshots, logs, or error messages make debugging easier. If it’s related to a specific environment (e.g. OS, Python version), let us know.

* **Check for duplicates**
  + Use the search bar in the Issues tab to see if someone else has already reported it. If so, consider commenting there instead of creating a new issue.

* **Give your issue a meaningful title**
  + A clear, descriptive title helps us (and others) quickly understand what the issue is about.

### Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature, please open an issue and include:

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A detailed description of the feature.
- Any benefits or potential drawbacks.
- Any other relevant information.

- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write comments to explain complex logic.

## Testing

- Write tests for your code.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Documentation

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- Ensure that any new code is documented.
