## Asking Questions

Each project will have a GitHub discussions tab, where all questions and support requests can go. Spend time framing questions and add links and resources; spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run! Here are some tips:

- [Talk to a duck!](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
- Don’t fall for the [XY problem.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
- Search our issues and discussions to find out if a similar question has been asked
- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  - Is there a concept you don’t understand?
- Provide sample code, such as a CodeSandbox or video, if possible
- Screenshots can help, but if there’s important text such as code or error messages in them, please also provide those as text
