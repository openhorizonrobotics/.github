# Support Hub

Thank you for using our projects! Whether you're just getting started or contributing actively, this guide outlines how to get support effectively.

> **Note:** before participating in our community, please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions. We expect everyone to uphold these standards.

# Before Asking for Help
Please check the following resources before submitting a request:


* **Documentation**
  + Review the official documentation and README files — many common questions are already answered there.


* **Existing Issues & Discussions**
  + Search through Issues and Discussions to see if someone else has already asked or solved your problem.
 
    
## Asking Questions

Asking thoughtful questions is a great way to contribute and learn. Most projects have a dedicated GitHub Discussions tab where you can post questions, share ideas, and request support. To help us (and you) get the most out of your query, keep these best practices in mind:

* **Take a Moment to Think Through Your Question**
  + Before posting, try explaining your problem to someone else (or even to a rubber duck!). This process — called [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/) can often help clarify your thinking and reveal the solution.


* **Are You Asking the Right Question?**
  + Avoid the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378). Don’t ask how to implement a solution without first clearly explaining the actual problem you're facing.


* **Check Before You Post**
  + Use GitHub’s search to see if your question or issue has already been addressed in:
      + *Existing Issues*
      + Open or closed Discussions
   
        
* **Be Clear About What You Need**
  + When writing your question, consider including:
      + *Your goal: What are you trying to accomplish?*
      + *Your blockers: What specifically is going wrong?*
      + *What you’ve tried: List steps, methods, or tools you’ve used already.*
      + *Conceptual confusion: If the problem is theoretical or conceptual, describe what part you’re stuck on.*


* **Share What You’re Working With**
  + Include a code snippet or minimal reproducible example (e.g., [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [Replit](https://replit.com/), or GitHub Gist).
  + If you're referencing something visual, include:
      + *Screenshots (optional)*
      + *Text-formatted error messages, logs, or code (mandatory if text is present in the image)*
